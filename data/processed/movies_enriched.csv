It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.","[{'id': 28, 'name': 'Action'}, {'id': 12, 'name': 'Adventure'}, {'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}, {'id': 36, 'name': 'History'}]",1959-12-26,/syPMBvvZsADTTRu3UKuxO1Wflq.jpg,ben-hur,100

He's diffident about prizes, celebrates Rome and Paris, salutes Naples and its people. He answers the question, why make bad films; recalls his father and grandfather, carpenters, his mother, deaf in her old age, and his brother, a film editor; he's modest about his looks. In repose, time's swift passage holds Mastroianni inward gaze.","[{'id': 99, 'name': 'Documentary'}]",1997-08-29,/fOjI7t91yG7oT7i4LsfTPjOlohF.jpg,marcello mastroianni: i remember,81

3598,Hamlet (2000),Drama,"Shakespeare's 17th century masterpiece about the ""Melancholy Dane"" was given one of its best screen treatments by Soviet director Grigori Kozintsev.

Hamlet himself is portrayed (by Innokenti Smoktunovsky) as the sole sensitive intellectual in a world made up of debauchers and revellers. Several of Kozintsev directorial choices seem deliberately calculated to inflame the purists: Hamlet's delivers his ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy with his back to the camera, allowing the audience to fill in its own interpretations.","[{'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}, {'id': 10769, 'name': 'Foreign'}]",1964-06-24,/vIds82FzTRRBqmHq7iaGogoeeC6.jpg,hamlet,100
